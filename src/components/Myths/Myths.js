      <q>Sex is something you perform</q>
      <q>Sex is all about a hard penis and what is done with it</q>
      <q>Sexual problems are a sign of weakness</q>
      <q>
        Men can have total control of their erection, anywhere and with anyone
        regardless of their feelings or situation
      </q>
      <q>Erections are related to physical strength and effort</q>
      <q>Your main responsibility in sex is to give pleasure to your partner</q>

      <p>
        Such beliefs are likely to increase feelings of anxiety and physical
        tension as they are unrealistic and misleading. Some beliefs lack a
        basic understanding of the physiology of erections or the conditions
        that cultivate an appetitive state. Other beliefs can be held so
        rigidly, that they offer no space for learning and growth. </p>
        <p>
        For example,
        if you believe that sex is all about penetration with your penis, it is
        likely to limit your options and potential for sexual pleasure. Imagine
        going to a restaurant with only one meal as an option on the menu â€“
        boring!
