          We experience emotional reactions (feelings) throughout the day, from
          excitement when meeting a good friend for lunch to irritation when
          getting stuck on the Underground. Feelings are experienced in our
          bodies as physiological reactions as well as our minds as thoughts or
          mental events.
        </P>

        <P>
          Our brains and bodies are interconnected in complex and subtle ways.
          Feelings are constantly changing throughout the day as we interact and
          respond to the world. Itâ€™s part of being alive. We even experience
          feelings when we are asleep.
        </P>

        <P>
          Self-criticism and catastrophising which tend to be associated with
          ED, together with avoidance behaviours are likely to create a vicious
          cycle that maintains ED.
        </P>

        <P>
          Explore and address unrealistic beliefs that might trigger and
          maintain your anxiety around sex.
        </P>

        <P>
          You can look in our resources section to learn more about your body
          and sexual wellbeing, or you can meet with a psychosexual therapist or
          mental health professional to discuss any difficulties you experience,
          in person.
