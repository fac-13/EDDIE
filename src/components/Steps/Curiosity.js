        You can start on your own by using the
        <a>mindful masturbation exercise</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim of this exercise is to increase your level of physical comfort
        and your awareness of what increases your pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        You might also find helpful to increase your awareness of the muscles
        around the genitals by practising <a>Kegels for Men</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, if you have a sexual partner, you can explore together sexual
        experiences that do not involve penetration (<a>Sensate Focus</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        This will help to increase your sexual repertoire and communication
        skills.
