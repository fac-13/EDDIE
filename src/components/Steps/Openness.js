        We experience emotional reactions (feelings) throughout the day, from
        excitement when meeting a good friend for lunch to irritation when
        getting stuck on the Underground. Feelings are experienced in our bodies
        as physiological reactions as well as our minds as thoughts or mental
        events.
      </p>

        Our brains and bodies are interconnected in complex and subtle ways.
        Feelings are constantly changing throughout the day as we interact and
        respond to the world. Itâ€™s part of being alive. We even experience
        feelings when we are asleep.
