      <p>
        Whether you have sex with a regular or casual partner, there is always
        some space to negotiate sexual relations that are both comfortable and
        enjoyable for both.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you are concerned about getting or staying hard with a
        new partner, you can always offer a number of alternative options and
        agree on it before you have sex.
      </p>

      <p>
        Equally, having sex with a regular partner can be familiar but it can
        also lack excitement. Being open about your sexual fantasies or sexual
        desires with your partner can cultivate your communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can both explore new ways to express yourselves and connect with
        each other.
