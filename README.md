Sexual Well-being for men with ED

## General Information

At any point in time 30-40% of men report experiencing some form of sexual health difficulty that impacts on their emotional, physical and relational wellbeing. One most common sexual health problem is erectile difficulties (ED).

On the other hand, there is very limited information about basic physiology and understanding of our bodies in sex, which has a major impact on how far people will go to avoid or hide such issues from their partners and others.

The application aims to introduce helpful information regarding the sexual well-being of men with ED.

## Design Sprint

After a one day Design Thinking workshop with our client and Product Owner, we decided to create EDDIE; an informative web based app for men with ED. The application aims to help men understand the underlying causes of ED, navigate through some user stories and find relevant resources quickly, instead of going via the NHS patient route.

### Aims of the project:

- Simple to use and accessible
- User friendly and engaging
- Read about realistic user stories and find out how they coped
- Understand the main causes and mechanism behind ED
- Access some basic exercises and interventions
- Adhere to current data protection laws

## Prototype

An initial prototype was created for user testing, that can be accessed via this link:
[Prototype v.1](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/FWJZAFVSC7R)

And an updated version of the prototype, based on corrections and user feedback :
[Prototype v.2](https://www.figma.com/proto/fWZHGTWYoIqpfdevZw8FXrm0/CuCu?scaling=contain&node-id=17%3A0)

## Target User

Edmund wants to enjoy sex but has been experiencing erectile difficulties recently and finds it difficult to discuss this issue with partner. Instead of waiting to be seen by a healthcare specialist, he wishes to find some basic information about this situation online and some simple steps he can take to tackle the issue.
